# Mars Rover Dashboard

## Udacity Intermediate JavaScript Nanodegree Program

### Project #2: Function Programming

This project creates a Mars Rover dashboard that consumes data from the NASA API.  The dashboard allows the user to select which rover's information they want to view.  Once a rover is selected, the user will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover as well as important information on the rover and its mission.
